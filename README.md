# 🪙 Ancient Coin Collection

A modern, responsive web application for managing and displaying your personal collection of ancient coins. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fast, lightweight experience.

## Features

- **📷 Image Upload**: Upload multiple images for each coin (front, back, details)
- **External Image URLs**: Reference optimized images hosted on a CDN or the local `/coin-images` folder instead of storing large blobs in LocalStorage
- **3D Model Viewer**: Upload and view 3D models (.glb, .gltf, .obj) with 360° rotation
- **Detailed Information**: Track comprehensive coin details including:
  - Name, date/period, origin/mint
  - Ruler/authority, material, weight, diameter
  - Obverse and reverse descriptions
  - Custom notes and descriptions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find coins in your collection
- **Sort Options**: Sort by newest, oldest, or alphabetically by name
- **Local Storage**: All data persists in your browser (no server required)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with smooth animations

## Getting Started

### Installation

No installation required! Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/famake3/coinflip.git
cd coinflip

# Open in browser
open index.html  # macOS
start index.html # Windows
xdg-open index.html # Linux
```

Or use a local development server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Usage

### Adding a Coin

1. Click the **"+ Add New Coin"** button
2. Fill in the coin details (Name and Date are required)
3. Upload images of your coin
4. (Optional) Provide external obverse/reverse image URLs. Relative paths such as `/coin-images/athens-obv.jpg` serve files from this repo's `coin-images` folder so you don't need a CDN.
5. Optionally upload a 3D model file
6. Click **"Save Coin"** to add it to your collection

### Viewing Coin Details

- Click on any coin card to view full details
- Use the 3D viewer to rotate and examine 3D models (if uploaded)
- View all uploaded images in high quality

### Managing Your Collection

- **Search**: Use the search bar to find coins by name, date, origin, ruler, or description
- **Sort**: Choose how to order your collection (newest first, oldest first, or by name)
- **Delete**: Remove coins from your collection using the delete button

### 3D Model Support

The application supports the following 3D model formats:
- `.glb` - Binary glTF
- `.gltf` - glTF JSON
- `.obj` - Wavefront OBJ

The 3D viewer features:
- Auto-rotation for 360° viewing
- Manual orbit controls (click and drag)
- Zoom in/out (scroll wheel)
- Proper lighting and shadows

### External Image URLs & `/coin-images`

- Drop optimized `.jpg` or `.png` files into the `coin-images/` folder in this repository. Any static dev server (Python, `http-server`, VS Code Live Server, etc.) will expose them at `http://localhost:PORT/coin-images/...`.
- In the form, paste either a full `https://` URL or a relative path such as `/coin-images/denarius-obv.jpg`. Those URLs take priority over uploaded files, so you can keep LocalStorage lean.
- External images remain referenced in exports/imports, so you can host them on a CDN or keep them in the repo for offline use. Just ensure the paths stay reachable wherever you open the app.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with flexbox and grid
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Vanilla JavaScript for functionality
- **Three.js** - 3D model rendering and viewer
- **LocalStorage API** - Client-side data persistence

## Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Data Storage

All coin data is stored locally in your browser using LocalStorage:
- Images are stored as base64-encoded strings
- 3D models are stored as base64-encoded files
- No server or database required
- Data persists between sessions
- Export/backup functionality can be added if needed

## Privacy & Security

- All data stays on your device
- No external servers or APIs (except CDN for Three.js library)
- No tracking or analytics
- Perfect for private collections

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Export/import collection data
- Print-friendly views
- Advanced filtering (by material, ruler, date range)
- Collection statistics and insights
- Multiple collection support
- Share individual coins via URL
 - Smarter historical context extraction (expanding beyond first paragraph)

## Wikipedia Context Cleaning

When building the "Learn More" cards (About the ruler / About the period / etc.), the app fetches a long Wikipedia extract. Some pages return an infobox converted to plain text at the top (field lists like "Reign", "Predecessor", "Born"), which duplicated structured data already resolved from Wikidata/Nomisma. A heuristic cleaner now strips those leading metadata lines and starts the summary at the first narrative sentence containing "was". This keeps the contextual paragraph while avoiding noisy tabular dumps. If you notice a page where the intro was trimmed incorrectly, open an issue with the raw first lines so the heuristic can be refined.
